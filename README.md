# React Meetups

My Impelementation of a code-along tutorial that was part of [React - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) course on Udemy, the app was built with Next.js including server side rendering and api node to a Mongo database.

The app enables anyone to see the meetups or add a new ones.

## Notes

The project was meant to be a demonestration/practice/application for the usage of the Next.js and therefore the current data are dummy ones.
